A Granule may be composed of one or more physical pieces (files) which are considered inseparable. For example, a data storage format that maintains metadata and binary data in separate, but tightly coupled files. Granules should not be used to group files that have simple relationships or which are associated through a parent resouce. For example, each file containing a time interval data for a Numerical Data resource would each be considered a Granule. The ParentID of a Granule resource must be a NumericalData resource. The attributes of a Granule supersede the corresponding attributes in the NumericalData resource."/> <!-- Granule -->
