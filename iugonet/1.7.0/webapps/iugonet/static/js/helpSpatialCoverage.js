The Stonyhurst Heliographic Coordinate System is supported in this search. In this coordinate system, left-hemisphere of the solar disk is defined as the eastern hemisphere and right-hemisphere is defined as the western hemisphere.\n\n[Example]\n                     North: N15 or +15\n  East : E40 or +40                 West : W30 or -30\n                     South: S25 or -25\n\n[Note] Currently, the IUGONET search system defines the sign of longitude on the eastern hemisphere as \"plus\" and that on the western hemisphere as \"minus\".");
